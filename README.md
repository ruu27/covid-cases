Analysis and Visualization of the correlation between Singapore events/holidays and COVID-19 case trends.

Objective: Identify the periods of time where there may be likely spikes or possibly many asymptomatic patients in the public (good for precaution and taking note of personal hygiene during this time).

Results:
- Successfully identified the 10-14 day spike trend.
- Quantitatively indicated the likelihood of spikes. 
    - 1-3 is a low to medium likelihood, and can indicate the start of asymptomatic infections or a mild second wave happening.
    - >=4 is a high likelihood, and there are probably many symptomatic infections already happening (coughing or flu-like symptoms have started and infection spread is thus high).
